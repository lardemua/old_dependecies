@brief
Contains packages concerning interface with sensors
without any dedicated data processing. The packages
connect to hardware or use other packages that interface
the low level (data acquisition from sensors and similar
devices). Occasionally, these packages may produce
several representations of the same data, such as polar
and cartesian measurements from environment.

@examples
camera
fusion
gps
human_driver_monitor
imu
laser
