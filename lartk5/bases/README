@file bases

@brief
Contains packages concerning the control of hardware
devices: the bases. Each base (one package) may contain
several nodes (executables) regarding different hardware
subsystems. The bases are normally robots basic motion
units or dedicated subsystems with own motion independent
of the robot motion itself. Most of these nodes use
other utils packages for motor driver interface and similar.
