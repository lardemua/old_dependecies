@brief
Contains packages concerned with sensorial data
interpretation and representation. It covers algorithms
to transform and extract from raw (or barely processed) 
sensorial data some kind of higher-level meaning.
This covers both for exteroception (enviroment) and
proprioception (robots internal state).

@examples
3D
atlascar_egomotion
driver_monitoring
driver_recognition
lidar_egomotion
navigability_map
parking_detection
